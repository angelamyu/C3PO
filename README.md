# C3PO
Cleavage and Counteraction with Compound 2 on Polyadenylation Outcomes 


## System Requirements
### Software dependencies and operating systems
- bbmerge V38 
- starcode version 1.4
- RNAStructure version 6.4
- Logomaker version 0.8
- JupyterLab version 3.2.2
- The software was developed and tested on AWS EC2 instance type g4dn.xlarge with the TensorFlow 2(+Keras2) with Python3.7 (CUDA + and Intel MKL-DNN) environment.
- Code with Residual Networks used the TensorFlow(+Keras2) with Python3 (CUDA + and Intel MKL-DNN) environment. 


### Versions the software system has been tested on
The software was developed and tested on versions and environments listed in "Software dependencies and operating systems". 


## Installation
All source code is included in this GitHub repository, and can be directly downloaded or cloned (`git clone git@github.com:angelamyu/C3PO.git`) which should take less than a minute. 

Software dependencies will be the most time consuming part of installation, so please refer to these dependencies for individual installation time estimates. 

## Demo
See example notebook for using C3PO: https://github.com/angelamyu/C3PO/blob/main/Example/C3PO_example.ipynb

This demo shows how to go from a list of sequences to C3PO predictions, and includes expected output. This entire example notebook should take 8 seconds to run.
